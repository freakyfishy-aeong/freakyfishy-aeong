- 👋 Hi, I’m @freakyfishy-aeong, an amateur programmer, applied artificial intelligence diploma student 
- 👩‍💻 So far, I have learned to develop
  1. web applications using HTML, CSS, JS, SQL;
  2. mobile applications using flutter(dart, firestore, authentication);
  3. and deploy a website using AWS services
  4. Machine learning model using python
  6. ... and more to come!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and web development basics. I have an interest to eventually explore other lower-level languages like C, Assembly just to understand how computers work better ><
